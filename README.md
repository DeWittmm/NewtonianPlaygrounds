These simple playgrounds are being developed to help students learn introductory college physics, in a way that's hopefully a lot more fun than introductory college physics. 


### Circular Motion

The Circular motion playground sets up a celestial "Physics World" (which encapsulates the SKScene and SKView) to demonstrate circular motion in the presence of a Radial Gravity Field.
