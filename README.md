### NewtonianPlaygrounds

The ultimate goal of the educational system is to shift to the individual the burden of pursuing his education.
- John W. Gardner

These simple playgrounds are being developed to help students learn introductory college phyiscs, in a way that's hopefully a lot more fun than introductory college physics. 

## Intro 


## Circiular Motion

The Circiular motion playground sets up a celestial "Physics World" (which encapsulates the SKScene and SKView) to demonstrate circular motion in the presence of a Radial Gravity Field. 



##Notes

Playgrounds utilizing SpriteKit must target OS X.
